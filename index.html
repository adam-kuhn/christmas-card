        <p class="center language">Kia ora ("Hello in Maori")! We hope that everyone is having a lovely Christmas surrounded by friends and family.
          <br>
          <br> This is our first true Christmas together as we are both away from our family and friends, so now we can start to develop our own traditions. Our Christmas present to ourselves is a weekend trip to Waiheke Island, where we will do a wine
          tour, lay on the beach, swim in the ocean, and explore the island on bikes. We will return from Waiheke on Christmas Eve. On Christmas Day the plan is to have a relaxing morning, have coffee (and Bailey's), and make banana chocolate chip pancakes.
          The once again it'll be off to the beach where we will lay in the sun and have a picnic for lunch. For dinner we plan to make quite the feast! For starters we will have cheese and crackers (with wine) and, smoked salmon and rye bread. Then it'll
          be beetroot casserole, mashed potatoes, spinach salad, and ham. And if we still aren't full there is even a potential for some cookies for dessert.
          <br>
          <br> We've been in New Zealand for two months now and so far we are loving it. Whenever we can we our spending time outside, exploring the city or relaxing on the beach. Elisa has found work as a Digital Marketing Assistant for Traffic which
          is an Advertising Agency. Traffic has already hinted at keeping her around beyond her current contract...so who knows maybe we will never leave?!
          <br>
          <br> Adam has found some temporary work as General Laborer at a construction site. It's quite different then his last position (a Geologist in Canada), but it's a welcomed change of pace. Adam is also studying Web Development in Auckland at
          Enspiral Dev Academy. He has completed the online portion of the course and begins the classroom portion of the program early January. Adam has enjoyed his program so far and is quite exciting to begin studying the classroom to learn even more.
          He as enjoyed learning about Web Development so much that he created this e-card all by himself (tooting his own horn now). Go ahead and click on some of the images and see what happens.
          <br>
          <br> We hope everyone has a wonderful holiday season and isn't to jealous of us lying on the beach.
